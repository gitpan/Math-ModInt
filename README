Math-ModInt version 0.001
=========================

Math::ModInt - modular integer arithmetic

Ilya>   Operator overloading allows user-defined behaviors for
        numbers, such as operations over arbitrarily large integers,
        floating points numbers with arbitrary precision, operations
        over "exotic" numbers such as MODULAR ARITHMETIC or p-adic
        arithmetic, and so on.

Joe>    Fine.  I want to do modular arithmetic in Perl syntax.  Is
        there a module for that?  (checking...)  Rats, no.

Martin> (after a while)  Now there is.
